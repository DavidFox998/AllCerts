# check-towers.sh — Build the opt-in Towers Lean library (mathlib-backed
# first bricks for the open towers: RH, BSD, Navier-Stokes,
# Yang-Mills) and verify each named brick's axiom debt is either
# empty or a subset of mathlib's classical core
# {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}.
#
# This script targets the SIBLING package at `lean-proof-towers/`. The
# main spine package `lean-proof/` is deliberately untouched: it stays
# mathlib-free so the fast spine drift guard (`check-lean-proof.sh`)
# keeps running in seconds.
#
# Cost (cold cache, no mathlib oleans on disk):
#   - `lake update` resolves the mathlib v4.12.0 git dep (sources).
#   - `lake exe cache get` downloads ~2 GB of prebuilt mathlib oleans
#     from the Lean community CDN. Typically 5–15 min on a reasonable
#     connection.
#   - `lake build Towers` then compiles the Towers library on top of
#     mathlib. Typically <1 min on warm cache.
#
# Cost (warm cache, mathlib oleans already on disk under
#       `lean-proof-towers/.lake/packages/mathlib/.lake/build/`):
#   - 10–30 seconds total.
#
# Behaviour when `lake` is missing or the cache fetch fails (e.g.
# offline sandbox): exits non-zero with a clear message. There is no
# "soft skip" mode — the towers-build workflow is the canonical place
# to surface mathlib-availability problems.
#
# Adding a new brick:
#   1. Add a `lean_lib` root in `lean-proof-towers/lakefile.lean`.
#   2. Append a pair `"<Towers module>|<fully-qualified theorem>"` to
#      the BRICKS array below. The script will build a tiny verifier
#      file per pair and run the axiom-footprint check.

# `lakefile.lean` and leaves `HEAD` dangling — every subsequent
# `lake build` then fails with "could not resolve 'HEAD'".
#
# `lake-manifest.json` is committed and pins every transitive dep to
# an exact revision, so as long as the package directories exist we
# do NOT need `lake update` to resolve anything; `lake build` reads

# `lake exe cache get` does a `git fetch` inside every dep package
# (batteries, aesop, importGraph, …) AND, when Lake sees that a
# package's checkout URL differs from the manifest (which it always
# does for our vendored, .git-less trees — Lake reads "no .git" as
# "URL changed"), re-clones the package from scratch. That single
# behaviour is the entire reason the towers-build workflow used to
# burn 5–15 minutes on every cold start re-downloading ~2 GB of
# prebuilt mathlib oleans (Task #66).
#
# Skip policy, in order of preference:
#
#   (1) FAST PATH — mathlib's prebuilt oleans look populated under
#       .lake/packages/mathlib/.lake/build/lib/. Skip `cache get`;
#       `lake build Towers` will read the on-disk oleans directly via
#       the manifest. Typical warm-cache run: 10-30 s.
#
#   (2) SAFE PATH — the vendored mathlib working tree exists but is
#       missing its `.git/` directory (and so are the sibling deps).
#       Running `cache get` here is *actively destructive*: Lake will
#       interpret the missing `.git` as a URL change and re-clone the
#       package, wiping the working tree AND the .lake/build oleans
#       in the process. Skip with a clear warning. If the oleans are
#       missing, `lake build Towers` will compile mathlib from source
#       (slow — 30+ min — but correct), which is strictly better than
#       silently destroying the vendored trees.
#
#   (3) GENUINE FETCH — neither the build dir nor the vendored trees
#       exist (truly fresh checkout). Run `cache get` normally.
#
# NB: avoid `find … | head -N | wc -l` here — under `set -o pipefail`
# the SIGPIPE from `head` closing early makes `find` exit non-zero and
# kills the whole script (we hit this exact failure in an earlier
# iteration; the workflow appeared to "succeed" with zero bricks
# checked because the script silently exited before the BRICKS loop).
# We just need a "are there many oleans?" probe, not an exact count;
# check for a small set of well-known olean paths and the build dir
# itself instead. Use multiple probes because the exact set of
# top-level oleans depends on which mathlib modules the Towers
# library has imported so far — `Mathlib.olean` (the all-encompassing
# umbrella) is only emitted after `import Mathlib`, whereas a leaner
# import set may only populate `Mathlib/Init.olean`, `Mathlib/Tactic.olean`,

  #     elsewhere). Honors the architect's Batch-4 recommendation to

  # (b) `lattice_deriv` is the GENUINE cyclic forward difference
  #     `(D_μ A)(i) := A(i+1) − A i` on `Fin n` with `[NeZero n]`,

  # is now genuinely non-trivial: for a generic gauge field `A` the
  # curvature is NOT identically zero, and `YMHamiltonian A := ∑ ‖curv i‖²`
  # is a real sum of squared norms. Five bricks, one per user-spec
  # item: (1) `structure_constants_su3_def` (`f^{012} = 1`, decidable);
