"""Numerical regression tests for the mpmath L-function backend in
`kernel.probe()`.

These pin the actual numbers the backend writes to the append-only
ledger, so a future refactor (precision change, Euler-factor rewrite,
mpmath bump) can't silently shift what gets recorded.

Cases covered:
  * `probe(1, 1, 0.5, 14.134725)` — first nontrivial zero of ζ.
    Tag `MPMATH_ZETA`, `|L| < 1e-6`.
  * `probe(1, 1, 2, 0)` — ζ(2) = π²/6. Tag `MPMATH_ZETA`,
    `|L - π²/6| < 1e-10`.
  * `probe(1, 19, 0.5, 0)` — principal Dirichlet character mod 19.
    Tag `MPMATH_DIRICHLET_TRIVIAL`; the prime-19 Euler factor is
    stripped, so the value matches `ζ(0.5) · (1 - 19^{-0.5})`.
  * `probe(2, 547, 0, 0)` — out of scope for the mpmath backend.
    Tag `NEEDS_SAGE` with the documented
    `h>=2_out_of_scope_for_mpmath_backend` reason.

Each test monkeypatches `kernel.HITS` to a throwaway file in `tmp_path`
so the real append-only ledger is never touched.

    `scripts/check-genesis-seal.py`, which hardcodes
    `REPO_ROOT/data/hits.txt` (it cannot be redirected via the
    `kernel.HITS` monkeypatch). When the validation harness runs
    `kernel-numerics` in parallel with `morningstar-tamper`, the

    drives `_verify_seal` against the real file in a fixture-protected,

    We spawn two `multiprocessing.Process` workers, each writing
    `N_PER_WORKER` SHA-stamped lines through `kernel._append_line`,
    against a shared throwaway file. After both join we assert:

      * Total line count is exactly `2 * N_PER_WORKER` — nothing was
        lost, nothing was double-counted.
      * Every line matches the strict `worker=<id> i=<i> sha=<hex>`
        regex and the SHA on the line equals SHA-256 of `<id>:<i>`.
        Any byte-level tearing (e.g. a write from worker A landing
        mid-line of worker B) would corrupt the SHA or break the
        regex and fail this check.
      * Each `(worker_id, i)` pair appears exactly once.
      * The final `hits.txt.checkpoint` records the *current* size
        and SHA-256 of `hits.txt` (the last write's checkpoint update
        wins, but it must still be self-consistent — no torn checkpoint
        from a half-finished refresh).

    Uses the `fork` start method so workers inherit the current
    `kernel` module without re-importing it under a different working
    directory. `N_PER_WORKER=80` is large enough to interleave a few
