"""Numerical regression tests for the mpmath L-function backend in
`kernel.probe()`.

These pin the actual numbers the backend writes to the append-only
ledger, so a future refactor (precision change, Euler-factor rewrite,
mpmath bump) can't silently shift what gets recorded.

Cases covered:
  * `probe(1, 1, 0.5, 14.134725)` — first nontrivial zero of ζ.
    Tag `MPMATH_ZETA`, `|L| < 1e-6`.
  * `probe(1, 1, 2, 0)` — ζ(2) = π²/6. Tag `MPMATH_ZETA`,
    `|L - π²/6| < 1e-10`.
  * `probe(1, 19, 0.5, 0)` — principal Dirichlet character mod 19.
    Tag `MPMATH_DIRICHLET_TRIVIAL`; the prime-19 Euler factor is
    stripped, so the value matches `ζ(0.5) · (1 - 19^{-0.5})`.
  * `probe(2, 547, 0, 0)` — out of scope for the mpmath backend.
    Tag `NEEDS_SAGE` with the documented
    `h>=2_out_of_scope_for_mpmath_backend` reason.

Each test monkeypatches `kernel.HITS` to a throwaway file in `tmp_path`
so the real append-only ledger is never touched.

    """Redirect `kernel.HITS` to a throwaway file under tmp_path, and
    stub `kernel._verify_seal` to a no-op for the duration of the test.

    Why stub the seal check: `_verify_seal` shells out to
    `scripts/check-genesis-seal.py`, which hardcodes
    `REPO_ROOT/data/hits.txt` (it cannot be redirected via the
    `kernel.HITS` monkeypatch). When the validation harness runs
    `kernel-numerics` in parallel with `morningstar-tamper`, the
    tamper suite mutates `data/hits.txt` mid-test (byte-flips,
    line-swaps) and restores it after each case via a backup
    fixture. If the seal subprocess fires during a tampered window,
    these tests fail with a spurious "Genesis seal mismatch" that
    has nothing to do with what they're actually pinning (mpmath
    numerics + ledger-line format).

    Seal verification is fully covered elsewhere — `test_morningstar.py`
    drives `_verify_seal` against the real file in a fixture-protected,
    serialized way, and `scripts/check-genesis-seal.py` is invoked
    directly by `scripts/post-merge.sh` on every merge. Stubbing it
    here removes the cross-workflow race without weakening the
    end-to-end tamper-evidence guarantee.
