Towers / Attempts / Clay  (Batch 20.1a — Surface #3)

**The Clay statement, in machine-checkable form.**

Holds the only `sorry` introduced by Batch 20.1a:

  `MassGap_YM4_Clay : ∀ T, AsymptoticFreedom T → ∃ Δ, IsMassGap T Δ`

NOT registered in BRICKS — see `scripts/check-towers.sh`. Its
presence does NOT promote the YM tower; YM stays
`Status: Open` (`docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2) and `MassGap_YM4_Clay` is
the open conjecture, not a proven theorem.

Sits alongside the existing Attempts stubs (`T_g.lean`,
`Perron.lean`, `UniformGap.lean`, `Enstrophy.lean`,
`ClusterExpansion.lean`, `OSHilbert.lean`) — same discipline, same
no-auto-promotion guarantee.

### What this file ships

  * `MassGap_YM4_Clay` — the Clay-flavoured statement
    `∀ (T : YM4_Continuum), AsymptoticFreedom T →
       ∃ Δ : ℝ, IsMassGap T Δ`, with the proof parked as `sorry`.

### What this file does NOT ship

  * Any proof of the Clay YM mass-gap conjecture.
  * Any axiom-bearing claim (the `sorry` lives in the body, so
    `#print axioms MassGap_YM4_Clay` reports `[sorryAx]`; that is
    why the identifier is NOT in BRICKS).
  * Any reference to the Varadhan small-`t` heat-kernel asymptotic
    (project task #156, separate track).

### Honest scope

The statement uses the schema definitions (`YM4_Continuum`,
`IsMassGap`, `AsymptoticFreedom` from `Towers/YM/Continuum.lean`).
Task #196 upgraded `IsMassGap T Δ` from the bare `0 < Δ` placeholder
to a spectral statement; Task #221 then tied it to a *fixed*
`T`-derived operator: `IsMassGap T Δ := OS.HasMassGap ℂ (continuumOp T) Δ`,
which unfolds to `0 < Δ ∧ Δ ≤ continuumScale T`. So the conclusion
`∃ Δ, IsMassGap T Δ` is now discharge-able only via the `T`-derived
*stand-in* operator `continuumOp T` (a scalar multiple of the identity,
spectrum `{1 - continuumScale T}`) — NOT via the real OS-reconstructed
continuum-YM Hamiltonian. The `sorry` stays parked because the *real*
Clay target requires that genuine Hilbert space and Hamiltonian
(Batches 20.1b → 20.1d), wiring the gap to the true continuum-YM
spectrum rather than a stand-in. Keeping the `sorry` in place across
the placeholder ⇒ real-spectrum refactor is the whole point of parking
it here.
