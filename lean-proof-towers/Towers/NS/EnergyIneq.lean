  # Towers.NS.EnergyIneq

  **Statement-only file. Contains no theorems and no proofs.** This
  file pins the Clay 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes global
  regularity conjecture as a future formalisation target, using a
  structured (rather than single-`sorry`) schema. As of Task #51
  (2026-05-26) the two previously `sorry`-backed schema defs
  (`H1Norm`, `HasFiniteEnergy`) have been replaced by concrete,
  minimal, mathlib-backed stand-ins, so the file is now
  `sorry`-free. mathlib v4.12.0 still ships none of the prerequisite
  PDE machinery (Sobolev spaces, Leray-Hopf weak solutions,
  divergence-free L² constraint, energy inequality); the new
  defs are honest placeholders, not the real PDE quantities.

  Because no body is `sorry` any more, `#print axioms
  NS_global_regular_statement` no longer displays `[sorryAx]`. The
  statement type-checks, but its *content* is the placeholder
  schema below, not the Clay conjecture.

  ## Deviations from Plan #51 literal spec

  Plan #51 as written contains an import and an identifier that do
  not exist in mathlib v4.12.0, and a structure-field syntax that is
  not valid in Lean 4. The following deviations were forced:

    1. `import Mathlib.Analysis.Distribution.SobolevSpace` **OMITTED.**
       This file does not exist in mathlib v4.12.0. The closest
       available is `Mathlib.Analysis.FunctionalSpaces.SobolevInequality`,
       which provides the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev *inequality* on
       `Lp`, not an `H^k` vector-field Sobolev space type with a
       `.norm` lookup. The TODO on `H1Norm` still names the intended
       future definition.
    2. `import Mathlib.Analysis.Calculus.ContDiff.Defs` **ADDED** (not
       in Plan #51) so that `ContDiff ℝ ⊤ (S.u t)` in the global-
       regularity statement elaborates. Also `Mathlib.Analysis.
       InnerProductSpace.PiL2` for `EuclideanSpace`.
    3. `HasFiniteEnergy` was used in Plan #51 but was deleted from
       `Towers/NS/Divergence.lean` in the previous step (when we
       stripped the placeholder axioms). Added back **here** as a
       local `def := sorry` so this file is self-contained.
    4. `VelocityField` declared as **`abbrev`** rather than `def`, so
       `S.u t` (where `S.u : VelocityField`) reduces to a function
       application on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3) → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)`
       without `@[reducible]` annotations elsewhere.
    5. Structure-field syntax `h_div_free : sorry` is **not** valid
       Lean 4 — a structure field's right-hand side after the colon
       must be a type, not a term. Replaced with `h_div_free : Prop`
       (an opaque proposition field) plus a docstring TODO naming the
       intended constraint. The semantic effect is identical: the
       proposition is left abstract, just at the field-type level
       rather than via a sorry-value default.
    6. `∞` (used as `ContDiff ℝ ∞ ...`) is replaced with `⊤`, which
       is the canonical mathlib spelling of "infinitely smooth" in
       `WithTop ℕ` and avoids notation-scope issues.

  ## What this file is NOT

  * Not a proof of NS global regularity.
  * Not a precise Lean statement (placeholders are opaque).
  * **Not a brick.** `scripts/check-towers.sh` explicitly excludes
    this file from `BRICKS`. The 7 real bricks (`divergence_add`,
    `divergence_smul`, etc.) do NOT import this file, so their axiom
    footprints remain in `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` —
    verified post-build.

  ## What this file IS

  * Stable citable Lean identifiers
    (`TheoremaAureum.Towers.NS.LeraySolution`,
    `TheoremaAureum.Towers.NS.NS_global_regular_statement`) that
    future plans can point to as the future target.
  * A flagged TODO surface — every `sorry` is paired with a `TODO:`
    naming the mathlib gap.

  ## Status

  Per `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3. Navier-Stokes global regularity:
  **Open.** No promotion.

  **Task #51 implementation note (2026-05-26).** The two schema
  defs below (`H1Norm`, `HasFiniteEnergy`) were previously
  `sorry`-backed placeholders, paired with an audit comment that
  declined every candidate mathlib replacement as either a
  disguised stub or a "substantively misleading" Clay-conjecture
  impersonation. Per Task #51, that policy is reversed: each def
  is now a concrete, minimal, mathlib-backed stand-in:

    * `H1Norm u t := ‖u t 0‖` — the Euclidean norm of the velocity
      field evaluated at the spatial origin at time `t`. Real-
      valued, depends on both `u` and `t`. Not the H¹ Sobolev norm.
    * `HasFiniteEnergy u₀ := ∃ M : ℝ, ∀ x, ‖u₀ 0 x‖ ≤ M` — bounded
      amplitude of `u₀` at time `0`. Real predicate. Not the
      L² energy bound `‖u₀(0,·)‖_{L²} < ∞`.

  These let `NS_global_regular_statement` type-check without
  `sorryAx`. The Navier-Stokes tower remains Open per
  `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3.

/-- **H¹ Sobolev norm** of a velocity field at time `t` —
    concretized (Task #51) as the Euclidean norm of `u t` at the
    spatial origin `0 : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)`. This is **not**
    the H¹ Sobolev norm; mathlib v4.12.0 has no
    `SobolevSpace.norm` on `H^1(ℝ³; ℝ³)`. It is a real-valued,
    deterministic function of `(u, t)` that lets downstream
    statements name a real number without `sorryAx`. -/

/-- **Finite-energy** initial-data predicate — concretized (Task
    #51) as the bounded-amplitude condition `∃ M, ∀ x, ‖u₀(0,x)‖ ≤ M`.
    This is **not** the L² energy bound `‖u₀(0,·)‖_{L²} < ∞`; it is
    a real `Prop` that lets `NS_global_regular_statement` quantify
    over "admissible" initial data without `sorryAx`. -/

/-- **Leray-Hopf weak solution with finite energy.**

    The two `Prop` fields `h_div_free` and `h_energy` are
    abstract-proposition placeholders for the divergence-free
    constraint and the energy inequality respectively. Per the
    deviation log above, Lean 4 does not accept `field : sorry` (a
    term in type position); leaving the field types as bare `Prop`
    is the equivalent honest placeholder. -/
