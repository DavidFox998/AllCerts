  # Towers.YM.MassGap

  **Mostly-statement file. As of the Task #51 + Task #55 merge
  (2026-05-26) all three previously `sorry`-backed schema defs
  (`HilbertSpace`, `YMHamiltonian`, `IsEigenstate`) have been
  replaced by concrete, mathlib-backed types** so the file is now
  `sorry`-free.

  Task #55 (Branch A) upgraded `HilbertSpace` to `lp (fun _ : ℕ
  => ℂ) 2`, the canonical separable infinite-dim ℓ²(ℕ,ℂ). Task
  #51 concretized `YMHamiltonian` as `∑ i : Fin 4, ((A
  i).1).trace.re` and `IsEigenstate H ψ` as `∃ μ : ℝ, ∀ A, H A =
  μ * (‖ψ‖ * ‖ψ‖)`. The schema is still **not** the real Clay
  Yang-Mills surface (no Wightman axioms, no Sobolev spaces, no
  trace-of-the-curvature-2-form, no Osterwalder–Schrader
  reconstruction). It is a typed, inhabited stand-in whose only
  purpose is to let downstream bricks reference a Hilbert space,
  a real-valued "Hamiltonian" function on `SU3Connection`, and
  an eigenstate predicate without tripping over `sorryAx`. This
  file pins the Clay Yang-Mills mass-gap conjecture as a future
  formalisation target, using a structured (rather than
  single-`sorry`) schema.

  The seven trio-clean SU(3) bricks proved below are:
  `SU3Connection_one_mul`, `SU3Connection_component_unitary`,
  `SU3Connection_component_det_one`, `SU3Connection_mul_one`,
  `SU3Connection_one_one`, `SU3Connection_component_mul_unitary`,
  `SU3Connection_component_mul_det_one`. Each is real SU(3)
  monoid / submonoid algebra (no `TrivialConfiguration` shortcut)
  with axiom footprint a subset of `{propext, Classical.choice,
  Quot.sound}`. None of them advances the YM tower past
  `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2); they are foundation
  bricks under the schema, not Millennium claims.

  ## Status of the schema after the Plan #52 MassGap refactor

  As of this refactor, the previously-opaque `SU3Connection : Type
  := sorry` has been replaced by a **concrete, sorry-free type**:

      abbrev SU3Connection : Type :=
        Fin 4 → Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup (Fin 3) ℂ

  This is the **trivial-bundle constant-coefficient case** of an
  SU(3) gauge connection on `ℝ⁴`: four constant SU(3)-valued fields,
  one per spacetime direction. It is **not** a connection on a
  non-trivial principal bundle — that would need
  `Mathlib.Geometry.Manifold.VectorBundle.Basic` and a `Connection`
  type, neither of which is plumbed up to where we need them in
  mathlib v4.12.0. But it is a real, inhabited, sorry-free type
  that future YM bricks can prove things about, using the real
  `Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup` API from
  `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/UnitaryGroup.lean`.

  **Correction to a prior internal note.** An earlier comment in
  this file (and in a planning message) claimed
  `Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.SpecialUnitaryGroup` was missing
  from mathlib v4.12.0. That was *technically* correct (no file by
  that name) but *substantively misleading*: `Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup`
  itself **does exist**, as an `abbrev` in
  `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/UnitaryGroup.lean` (line 180):

      abbrev specialUnitaryGroup := unitaryGroup n α ⊓ MonoidHom.mker detMonoidHom

  This refactor uses it directly. The earlier "OMITTED" line about
  the SpecialUnitaryGroup file is preserved below for historical
  honesty, with a corrected pointer to where the type actually lives.

  ## Concretized schema defs (NOT the Clay surface)

    * `HilbertSpace      := lp (fun _ : ℕ => ℂ) 2`
    * `YMHamiltonian A   := ∑ i : Fin 4, ((A i).1).trace.re`
    * `IsEigenstate H ψ  := ∃ μ : ℝ, ∀ A, H A = μ * (‖ψ‖ * ‖ψ‖)`

  These are honest, mathlib-backed stand-ins, not the Clay
  surface. `HilbertSpace` is ℓ²(ℕ,ℂ) — a real separable
  infinite-dim complex Hilbert space, but NOT the Osterwalder–
  Schrader-reconstructed YM physical state space (which does not
  exist in mathlib v4.12.0 and is itself open research).
  `YMHamiltonian` is a sum of traces of connection components,
  NOT `∫ tr(F_A ∧ ★F_A)`. `IsEigenstate` is a quantitative
  scaling predicate that captures the *form* of "H has constant
  value μ‖ψ‖² on every connection", NOT the spectral-eigenvector
  property of an operator on the physical Hilbert space.

  Because these defs are now concrete (no `sorry`), `#print axioms
  YM_mass_gap_statement` no longer displays `[sorryAx]`. The statement
  type-checks, but its *content* is the placeholder above — not the
  Clay conjecture. `YM_mass_gap_statement` remains NOT a brick, is
  NOT in `scripts/check-towers.sh BRICKS`, and is NOT imported by
  any of the bricks that ARE in BRICKS.

  ## What this file IS now (post-refactor)

  * Seven real trio-clean SU(3) bricks (listed above) using the
    concrete `SU3Connection` type and the real
    `Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup (Fin 3) ℂ` monoid structure.
    Axiom footprint of each = subset of mathlib's classical trio.
  * Stable citable Lean identifiers for future plans to point at.
  * A flagged TODO surface: every remaining `sorry` is paired with a
    `TODO:` comment naming the mathlib module that would replace it.

  ## Status

  Per `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2. Yang-Mills mass gap: **Open.** No
  promotion. The fact that `SU3Connection`, `HilbertSpace`,
  `YMHamiltonian`, and `IsEigenstate` are now all concrete and
  the file is `sorry`-free does NOT change the tower's status. The
  concretizations are honest stand-ins (ℓ²(ℕ,ℂ) Hilbert space,
  sum-of-traces "Hamiltonian", scaling-form eigenstate predicate),
  not the Clay surface — even with `HilbertSpace = ℓ²(ℕ,ℂ)` the
  resulting `YM_mass_gap_statement` is a statement about ℓ²(ℕ,ℂ),
  NOT the real YM Hilbert space, which requires an Osterwalder–
  Schrader reconstruction not present in mathlib v4.12.0. The
  mass gap is not proved, not stated precisely as Yang-Mills
  physics, and not in sight.

  **Task #51 + Task #55 merge note (2026-05-26).** The three
  schema defs below (`HilbertSpace`, `YMHamiltonian`,
  `IsEigenstate`) were previously `sorry`-backed placeholders.

  Task #55 (Branch A) replaced `HilbertSpace` with `lp (fun _ : ℕ
  => ℂ) 2`, the canonical separable infinite-dim ℓ²(ℕ,ℂ). Branches
  B (symmetric Fock space) and C (su(3)-valued L²) were deferred
  because (B) mathlib v4.12.0 has no `SymmetricFockSpace` / no
  Hilbert-completion of a tensor algebra / no second-quantization
  machinery; (C) requires first defining `𝔰𝔲(3)` as a subtype
  with `InnerProductSpace ℝ` instances and lifting to `Lp`.

  Task #51 then replaced `YMHamiltonian` with `∑ i : Fin 4, ((A
  i).1).trace.re` (a real-valued, deterministic function of the
  four SU(3) components, computed from the genuine `Matrix.trace`
  of each connection component — NOT `∫ tr(F ∧ ★F)`) and
  `IsEigenstate H ψ` with `∃ μ : ℝ, ∀ A, H A = μ * (‖ψ‖ * ‖ψ‖)`
  (the "H scales uniformly by μ times the squared norm of ψ"
  predicate — NOT the spectral-eigenvector property of an operator
  on the physical Hilbert space).

  **Honest-scoping rule that survives both upgrades.** ℓ²(ℕ,ℂ)
  is THE canonical separable infinite-dimensional complex Hilbert
  space, but it is NOT the Yang-Mills physical Hilbert space. The
  actual YM Hilbert space is built by an Osterwalder–Schrader
  reconstruction from a constructed Euclidean YM measure that does
  not exist in mathlib v4.12.0 (and is itself an open research
  problem for 4D pure YM). `YM_mass_gap_statement` below now
  type-checks without `sorryAx`, but THAT TYPE-CHECKING IS NOT A
  FORMALIZATION OF THE CLAY CONJECTURE — it is a Prop about
  ℓ²(ℕ,ℂ) and the placeholder Hamiltonian / eigenstate predicate
  above, vacuous as Yang-Mills physics. Tower status: **Open**
  (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2). Promoting past `Open` requires the
  real YM Hilbert space and Hamiltonian, neither of which is
  plumbed up. See `IsEigenstate_zero_zero` below for the first
  downstream brick that uses the post-merge schema.
-/

/-- **Hilbert space placeholder for the schema.**

    Defined as `lp (fun _ : ℕ => ℂ) 2`, the canonical separable
    infinite-dimensional complex Hilbert space (ℓ²(ℕ, ℂ)) —
    `NormedAddCommGroup`, `InnerProductSpace ℂ`, and `CompleteSpace`
    all come from mathlib's `Mathlib.Analysis.InnerProductSpace.l2Space`.

    **This is NOT the Yang-Mills physical state space.** It is a
    real, infinite-dimensional, mathlib-backed Hilbert space chosen
    so the schema below (`YM_mass_gap_statement`) typechecks against
    something real instead of a `sorry`. The actual YM Hilbert space
    requires an Osterwalder–Schrader reconstruction from a
    constructed 4D Euclidean YM measure, which is not in mathlib
    v4.12.0 and is itself an open research problem. See the
    "Task #51 + Task #55 merge note" block immediately above for
    the full honest-scoping argument. -/
abbrev HilbertSpace : Type := lp (fun _ : ℕ => ℂ) 2
-- TODO (mathlib v4.13+ / OS-reconstruction): replace with the actual
-- physical-state Hilbert space of the YM Hamiltonian.

/-- **Yang-Mills Hamiltonian** — concretized (Task #51) as the sum
    of real parts of the matrix traces of the four SU(3) components.
    This is **not** the gauge-invariant field energy
    `∫ tr(F_A ∧ ★F_A)`; it is a real-valued, deterministic function
    of `A` that exercises the genuine `Matrix.trace` API on each
    component. -/

  (Finset.univ : Finset (Fin 4)).sum (fun i => ((A i).1).trace.re)

/-- **Eigenstate predicate** — concretized (Task #51) as the
    "uniform scaling by μ · ‖ψ‖²" form. `IsEigenstate H ψ` holds
    iff there exists a real scalar `μ` such that for every
    connection `A`, `H A = μ * (‖ψ‖ * ‖ψ‖)`. This is **not** the
    spectral-eigenvector property of an operator on a physical
    Hilbert space; it is the minimal real `Prop` that captures the
    *form* of "H is a constant multiple of ψ's squared norm" and
    lets downstream bricks state eigenstate-flavoured claims
    without `sorryAx`. -/
def IsEigenstate (H : SU3Connection → ℝ) (ψ : HilbertSpace) : Prop :=
  ∃ μ : ℝ, ∀ A : SU3Connection, H A = μ * (‖ψ‖ * ‖ψ‖)
-- TODO (mathlib v4.13+): ψ is a true eigenstate of H as a self-adjoint
-- operator on the YM physical-state Hilbert space.

/-- **Mass gap statement:** `∃ Δ > 0, ∀ eigenstates ψ, E_ψ ≥ Δ`.
    This is NOT a theorem — it is the Clay conjecture restated in
    Lean using the placeholder defs above. It is not in BRICKS.
    With the Task #51 concretizations in place, this now
    type-checks without `sorryAx`, but its *content* is still the
    placeholder schema (finite-dim Hilbert space, sum-of-traces
    Hamiltonian, scaling-form eigenstate predicate), not the Clay
    YM mass gap. -/
def YM_mass_gap_statement : Prop :=
  ∃ Δ : ℝ, 0 < Δ ∧ ∀ (A : SU3Connection) (ψ : HilbertSpace),
    IsEigenstate YMHamiltonian ψ → YMHamiltonian A ≥ Δ

/-- **The zero state is a (trivial) eigenstate of the zero Hamiltonian
    (eighth brick in `MassGap.lean`, first brick to use the Task #51
    concretized schema).**

    For the constant-zero "Hamiltonian" `fun _ => 0` and the zero
    vector `0 : HilbertSpace`, the predicate `IsEigenstate` holds —
    witnessed by `μ = 0`, since `0 = 0 * (‖(0 : HilbertSpace)‖ *
    ‖(0 : HilbertSpace)‖)` by `zero_mul`.

    This brick exists to demonstrate that the concretized
    `HilbertSpace` and `IsEigenstate` are not dead schema: they
    expose enough API (norm, zero vector, multiplication on `ℝ`)
    that a downstream proof can actually mention them by name and
    discharge a genuine Prop. The mathematics is intentionally
    trivial — `0 = 0` — but the *types* (real `EuclideanSpace ℂ
    (Fin 3)` for `ψ`, real `SU3Connection → ℝ` for `H`) are the
    post-Task-#51 schema.

    Axiom footprint: subset of mathlib's classical core
    `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`. No research-grade
    axioms.

    **Honest scoping reminder.** This does **not** advance the YM
    tower past `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2). It
    says only that the zero vector trivially satisfies the
    placeholder eigenstate predicate against the zero Hamiltonian.
    No claim about the YM Hamiltonian, mass gap, or any QFT
    statement. -/
theorem IsEigenstate_zero_zero :
    IsEigenstate (fun _ : SU3Connection => (0 : ℝ)) (0 : HilbertSpace) :=
  ⟨0, fun _ => (zero_mul _).symm⟩

/-- **Identity acts trivially on each component of an SU(3) connection
    (first real trio-clean brick in `MassGap.lean`).**

    For any `SU3Connection` `A` and any spacetime direction
    `i : Fin 4`,

      `(1 : Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup (Fin 3) ℂ) * A i = A i`.

    The proof is a one-line delegation to mathlib's `one_mul` on the
    monoid structure of `Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup (Fin 3) ℂ`
    (which `specialUnitaryGroup` inherits as a `Submonoid` of
    `Matrix (Fin 3) (Fin 3) ℂ` via `Submonoid.toMonoid`).

    This is **not** new mathematics — it is the trivial left-identity
    law of the SU(3) monoid, applied to one component of the
    trivial-bundle SU(3) connection schema. Its purpose is to be
    the **first real demonstration** that the post-refactor
    `SU3Connection` type is a usable mathlib-flavoured surface,
    rather than an opaque `sorry`-def.

    Axiom footprint: subset of mathlib's classical core
    `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` (verified by
    `scripts/check-towers.sh`). No research-grade axioms.

    **Honest scoping reminder.** This still does **not** advance the
    YM tower past `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2). It
    proves *nothing* about the Yang-Mills mass gap, the YM
    Hamiltonian, the physical-state Hilbert space, or any QFT
    statement. It says only that `1 * x = x` in the SU(3) monoid,
    on one component of a placeholder connection. -/
theorem SU3Connection_one_mul (A : SU3Connection) (i : Fin 4) :
    (1 : Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup (Fin 3) ℂ) * A i = A i :=
  one_mul (A i)

/-- **Each component of an SU(3) connection is unitary
    (second real brick in `MassGap.lean`).**

    For any `SU3Connection` `A` and any spacetime direction
    `i : Fin 4`, the underlying `3×3` complex matrix of `A i`
    satisfies the unitarity equation

      `(A i).1 * star ((A i).1) = 1`

    where `.1` extracts the underlying `Matrix (Fin 3) (Fin 3) ℂ`
    from the `specialUnitaryGroup` subtype.

    The proof unfolds membership through mathlib's
    `Matrix.mem_specialUnitaryGroup_iff`
    (`A ∈ specialUnitaryGroup n α ↔ A ∈ unitaryGroup n α ∧ A.det = 1`)
    to extract the unitarity component, then unfolds that through
    `Matrix.mem_unitaryGroup_iff`
    (`A ∈ unitaryGroup n α ↔ A * star A = 1`).

    Unlike `SU3Connection_one_mul` (which only used the abstract
    monoid identity), this brick is **substantive**: it proves the
    defining property of the unitary subgroup — `M M* = I` — using
    the real mathlib `Matrix.unitaryGroup` API, instantiated at the
    SU(3) connection components of our trivial-bundle schema.

    Axiom footprint: subset of mathlib's classical core
    `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` (verified by
    `scripts/check-towers.sh`). No research-grade axioms.

    **Honest scoping reminder.** This still does **not** advance the
    YM tower past `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2). It
    proves only that each constant SU(3)-matrix in the trivial-bundle
    schema is in fact unitary — which it is by typing. No claim
    about the YM Hamiltonian, mass gap, eigenstates, or any QFT
    statement. `HilbertSpace`, `YMHamiltonian`, and `IsEigenstate`
    are all concrete (Task #55 + Task #51 merge), but the
    concretizations are honest stand-ins, NOT the YM physical
    surface (see the "Task #51 + Task #55 merge note" block). -/
theorem SU3Connection_component_unitary (A : SU3Connection) (i : Fin 4) :
    (A i).1 * star (A i).1 = 1 := by

  exact Matrix.mem_unitaryGroup_iff.mp h.1

/-- **Each component of an SU(3) connection has determinant 1
    (third real brick in `MassGap.lean`).**

    For any `SU3Connection` `A` and any spacetime direction
    `i : Fin 4`, the underlying `3×3` complex matrix of `A i` has
    determinant `1`:

      `(A i).1.det = 1`.

    This is the *special* in **S**U(3) — the determinant-one
    constraint that distinguishes the special unitary group from
    the full unitary group. The proof unfolds membership through
    mathlib's `Matrix.mem_specialUnitaryGroup_iff`
    (`A ∈ specialUnitaryGroup n α ↔ A ∈ unitaryGroup n α ∧ A.det = 1`)
    and projects out the determinant component.

    Together with `SU3Connection_component_unitary` (just above),
    this completes the pair of defining properties of the SU(3)
    subgroup acting on each component of our trivial-bundle
    connection schema: each component matrix is *unitary* AND has
    *determinant one*. These two bricks are the most informative
    use so far of the post-refactor `MassGap.lean` surface —
    actually proving things about the SU(3) structure, not just
    abstract monoid identities.

/-- **Right-identity for SU(3) connection components
    (fourth brick in `MassGap.lean`).**

    For any `SU3Connection` `A` and any spacetime direction
    `i : Fin 4`,

      `A i * (1 : Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup (Fin 3) ℂ) = A i`.

    The proof is a one-line delegation to mathlib's `mul_one` on
    the monoid structure of `Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup (Fin 3) ℂ`.
    This is the right-identity companion to `SU3Connection_one_mul`
    (left-identity); together they say the SU(3) monoid identity
    fixes every component on both sides.

    This is **not** new mathematics — it is the trivial right-identity
    law of the SU(3) monoid, applied to one component of the
    trivial-bundle SU(3) connection schema.

    A one-line `mul_one 1` on the SU(3) submonoid. Trivial as
    monoid arithmetic, but the *type* is real SU(3) — not a stub,

/-- **Product of two SU(3)-connection components is unitary
    (sixth brick in `MassGap.lean`).**

    For any two SU(3) connections `A B : SU3Connection` and any
    spacetime direction `i : Fin 4`,

      `(A i).1 * (B i).1 ∈ Matrix.unitaryGroup (Fin 3) ℂ`.

    The proof invokes `Submonoid.mul_mem` on the unitary submonoid:
    if `A i` is unitary and `B i` is unitary, their matrix product
    is unitary. The unitarity of each factor is `component_unitary`
    extracted via `Matrix.mem_specialUnitaryGroup_iff.mp _ |>.1`.

    Genuine algebraic content: it exercises submonoid closure of
    `Matrix.unitaryGroup` under multiplication, a real mathlib
    structure result, not just a definitional unfolding.

    For any two SU(3) connections `A B : SU3Connection` and any
    spacetime direction `i : Fin 4`,

      `((A i).1 * (B i).1).det = 1`.

    The proof uses `Matrix.det_mul` (the genuine multiplicative
    property of the determinant — a real mathlib theorem, not a
    definitional unfolding) together with `component_det_one` on
    each factor; `mul_one` finishes.

    Genuine algebraic content: it exercises `Matrix.det_mul`,
    which is the key fact that `det : Matrix n n R → R` is a
    monoid homomorphism. This is the closure-under-multiplication
    proof for the determinant-1 hyperplane, the SL-side of the
    SU(3) algebraic structure (companion to
