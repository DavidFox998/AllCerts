Towers / YM / PeterWeylHeatVaradhan  (Task #156 — Varadhan small-t
asymptotic for the SU(3) heat-kernel envelope, **strip form**)

**Headline.** A sorry-free Varadhan-shape upper bound on the
genuine SU(3) Peter-Weyl heat-kernel envelope
  `Heat_kernel_envelope_real t :=
       ∑'_{(m,n) : ℕ²} (dim λ)² · exp(-(t · C₂(λ)))`
(landed in `Towers/YM/PeterWeylHeat.lean` via
`PeterWeyl_Summable_SU3`, Batch 19.1p-redux-a/b, Tasks #154/#155).
For every `t : ℝ` in the **finite strip** `[varadhan_t_lo, varadhan_t_top]`
(concretely `[1, 2]`), with explicit positive constants
`varadhan_c, varadhan_C`, the brick

  `Heat_kernel_envelope_real_le_varadhan :`
      `varadhan_t_lo ≤ t → t ≤ varadhan_t_top →`
      `Heat_kernel_envelope_real t ≤`
        `varadhan_C * Real.exp (-(varadhan_c / t)) / t ^ 4`

closes by composing (1) antitonicity of the envelope in `t` on
`(0,∞)` (each summand `exp(-(t·C₂))` decreases in `t` since `C₂ ≥ 0`,
both partial sums are `Summable` via `PeterWeyl_Summable_SU3` so
`tsum_le_tsum` applies), and (2) the algebraic fact that on the
strip `[t_lo, t_top]`, both `t_top^4 / t^4 ≥ 1` and the exp factor
`exp(c/t_lo) · exp(-c/t) ≥ exp(0) = 1` (since `t ≥ t_lo > 0` and
`c > 0` force `c/t ≤ c/t_lo`). Hence `varadhan_C · exp(-c/t)/t^4
≥ env(t_lo) ≥ env(t)` on the strip.

### Drift from the original task signature (honest scope, locked)

The Task #156 "Done looks like" line asked for the unrestricted
small-`t` shape
  `∀ t, 0 < t → t ≤ t₀ → env(t) ≤ C · exp(-c/t) / t^4`
for explicit positive `C, c, t₀`. **That statement is mathematically
false** for any positive `C, c, t₀` and the genuine envelope: as
`t → 0⁺`,
  - LHS `env(t) → +∞` (the SU(3) heat-trace blows up like `t^{-4}`,
    the Weyl-law `t^{-d/2}` with `d = dim_ℝ SU(3) = 8`),
  - RHS `C · exp(-c/t) / t^4 → 0` (the `exp(-c/t)` factor crushes
    `t^{-4}` to zero exponentially fast).
So no Varadhan-shape upper bound with `c > 0` can hold on any open
neighbourhood of `0`. The `exp(-c/t)` factor is the **off-diagonal**
Varadhan/Molchanov small-`t` asymptotic
  `K_t(x, y) ~ (4πt)^{-d/2} · exp(-d_g(x,y)² / 4t)`,
which collapses to the pure `t^{-d/2}` blow-up on the diagonal
`x = y` (where `d_g(x,x) = 0`). The repo's `Heat_kernel_def_real t
:= exp(-c/t) / t^4` placeholder is the off-diagonal shape; the
envelope is the on-diagonal trace, and the two cannot be related by
the literal Varadhan inequality without either (a) `c ≤ 0` or
(b) a lower bound on `t` away from `0`.

This file ships option (b): a **strip-form** Varadhan-shape bound
with `0 < t_lo ≤ t ≤ t_top`. The original task's "or honest
documentation of why the linear bound suffices for the chosen C, c"
escape hatch covers this drift: the strip carries no claim about
the small-`t` asymptotic regime, only the comparison shape inside
a bounded `t`-window — which is what a real off-diagonal Varadhan
bound + finite-volume cutoff would consume downstream once the
bi-invariant SU(3) Riemannian metric (Killing form) lands (not in
mathlib v4.12.0). The constants are nonetheless traceable to the
SU(3) Casimir via the `PeterWeyl_Summable_SU3` proof chain, since
`varadhan_C` is built directly from `Heat_kernel_envelope_real
varadhan_t_lo`, which in turn is dominated by the
Casimir/Weyl-dim product envelope of Bricks 1+2+3 in
`Towers/YM/PeterWeyl.lean`.

### Honest scope (locked)

This file is **not**:
  * the small-`t` Varadhan / Molchanov asymptotic on the open
    neighbourhood of `0` (mathematically false in the stated shape,
    see drift block above),
  * a heat-trace bound of the form `K(t) ≤ C · t^{-d/2}`
    (file 3 of 6 — `Towers/YM/HeatTraceBound.lean`, not landed),
  * the off-diagonal heat kernel `K_t(g, e)` or any SU(3)
    bi-invariant metric `d_{SU(3)}(g, e)` (file 4 of 6 — requires
    Killing-form geometry not in mathlib v4.12.0),
  * a constructive 4D pure-Yang-Mills measure,
  * a mass-gap lower bound on any YM Hamiltonian,
  * a substantive close of `kotecky_preiss_criterion` (still a
    `sorry` in `Towers/Attempts/ClusterExpansion.lean`).

/-- **Antitonicity of the SU(3) heat-kernel envelope.** For
`0 < t₁ ≤ t₂`, `Heat_kernel_envelope_real t₂ ≤ Heat_kernel_envelope_real t₁`.

Proof: every summand `(dim λ)² · exp(-(t · C₂(λ)))` is antitone in
`t` since `C₂(λ) ≥ 0` and `exp` is monotone. Both partial sums are
`Summable` via `PeterWeyl_Summable_SU3`, so `tsum_le_tsum` closes. -/

/-! ## Headline — strip-form Varadhan-shape upper bound -/

/-- **Varadhan-shape upper bound on the SU(3) Peter-Weyl heat-kernel
envelope, strip form.** For every `t : ℝ` with
`varadhan_t_lo ≤ t ≤ varadhan_t_top`,
  `Heat_kernel_envelope_real t ≤ varadhan_C · exp(-(varadhan_c / t)) / t^4`.

See the file preamble for the (honest, locked) explanation of why
this is the strip form rather than the unrestricted small-`t` shape
asked for by the Task #156 "Done looks like" line — the literal
statement is mathematically false at any positive `(C, c, t₀)`
because `env(t) → +∞` as `t → 0⁺` while `C · exp(-c/t) / t^4 → 0`.

Proof sketch.
  - Antitonicity of `env` in `t` on `(0, ∞)` gives
    `env(t) ≤ env(t_lo)`.
  - Algebraic strip fact:
      `C · exp(-c/t) / t^4`
        = `env(t_lo) · (t_top^4 / t^4) · exp(c/t_lo) · exp(-c/t)`
        ≥ `env(t_lo) · 1 · 1`         (each factor `≥ 1`)
        = `env(t_lo)`,
    where `t_top^4 / t^4 ≥ 1` because `t ≤ t_top`, and
    `exp(c/t_lo - c/t) ≥ exp(0) = 1` because `c > 0` and
    `c/t ≤ c/t_lo` (since `t_lo ≤ t > 0`).
  - Chain the two. -/

/-! ## Geometric (off-diagonal Varadhan-shape) brick — Task #170 -/

/-- **Geometric decay constant** `c_geom(x) := d_SU3(x, 1)² / 4`.
This is the **off-diagonal** Varadhan/Molchanov small-`t` constant
`d_g(x, e)² / 4` from `K_t(x, e) ≲ t^{-d/2} · exp(-d(x, e)² / 4t)`
— now expressed against the stand-in bi-invariant distance
`d_SU3 : SU3 → SU3 → ℝ` from `Towers/YM/RiemannianGeometry.lean`.

Because `d_SU3 ≡ 0` in the current stand-in, `c_geom(x) = 0` for
every `x`. Replacing `d_SU3` with the real Killing-form distance
will *intentionally* break the downstream geometric brick (since
the proof exploits `d_SU3 x 1 = 0` rfl-style) — that is the
tripwire signalling a real off-diagonal Varadhan bound has
landed. -/

/-- **Geometric-form Varadhan-shape upper bound on the SU(3)
Peter-Weyl heat-kernel envelope, strip form (Task #170).** For
every `t : ℝ` with `varadhan_t_lo ≤ t ≤ varadhan_t_top` and every
`x : SU3`,
  `Heat_kernel_envelope_real t ≤`
      `varadhan_C · exp(-(d_SU3 x 1)^2 / (4 · t)) / t^4`.

This is the **shape** the real off-diagonal Varadhan asymptotic
would consume — the same `exp(-d(x, e)² / 4t)` factor and the
same `t^{-4}` polynomial decay. Because the stand-in distance
`d_SU3 ≡ 0` (file `Towers/YM/RiemannianGeometry.lean`), the
`exp(-d(x, 1)² / (4t))` factor collapses to `exp 0 = 1` and the
brick is provable from the existing strip bound
`Heat_kernel_envelope_real_le_varadhan` plus `exp(-c/t) ≤ 1` for
`c, t > 0`.

**Honest scope (locked).** This is NOT the real off-diagonal
Varadhan / Molchanov asymptotic — see the file preamble and the
`RiemannianGeometry.lean` docstring. The signature carries the
geometric `d²/4` constant so that downstream consumers (KP
wire-up, files 5-6 of Task #156) can be written against the
right shape, but no claim is made that `d_SU3` is the genuine
SU(3) Killing-form distance. YM tower stays `Status: Open`. -/
